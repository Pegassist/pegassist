    <h2 className="static-header">About Pegassist.app</h2>
    <p>
      Pegassist (v 0.8 beta) is a web app to design prime editing guide RNA
      (pegRNA) for genome editing with Cas9 nickaseâ€“reverse transcriptase
      fusions previously described by Liu and colleagues (Anzalone et al. Nature
      2019).
    </p>

    <h3 className="static-header">Instructions</h3>
    <p>
      Give Pegassist your target genomic sequence and the edits you want to
      introduce. The app will propose sequences for a Prime Editing strategy,
      along with a cloning strategy to build these reagents using the Pegassist
      plasmid set (available soon on Addgene) developed by Richardson, Steyert,
      et al. 2021 in prep or those developed by Anzalone et al. 2019.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can keep the default options, or choose to look under the hood using
      Advanced Options to tweak parameters. Bear in mind, Prime Editing is an
      evolving technology, and this app is in beta. Pegassist outputs are based
      on available performance data as of January 2021 and may require
      experimental validation.
